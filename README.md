# Giga Chunker
High performance 3D terrain generation for the Unity Engine, written in 100% C#.

Driven by the new [C# Job System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/JobSystem.html)
and [Burst Compiler](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.burst@1.6/manual/index.html)
using a algorithm modeled after [Marching Cubes](http://paulbourke.net/geometry/polygonise/),
terrain can be generated on the CPU at lightning speeds.
